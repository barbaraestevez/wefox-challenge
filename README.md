# Bárbara Estévez – Wefox Frontend Challenge

## TODO's
Create a dummy app, using typescript, that contains a React client that consumes the API that Wefox provides so the app can:
- List
- Show
- Create
- Update
- Remove

### Optional
- Use a CSS framework if it helps in the UI
- Deploy the application somewhere (netlify or heroku can be suitable options) so we can play with it easily

### Notes
- The client side doesn't have to be dockerized, is up to you
- **When the test is delivered there shouldn't be more changes in the repository**, if you want to continue making changes, please make them in a separate branch

### Extra points
- **Creativity**

    Add extra & cool features (for example: Create a DataTable to list posts, play with lat/long fields adding a map, etc)


- **Tests**
    
    Add unit or integration tests to ensure that the code is working as expected

## Start the project locally

To start you have to clone the repository. 
Also, you need to run locally the API using docker-compose (you've available the config on docker-compose.yml file).
The you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
